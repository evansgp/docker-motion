# docker-motioneye

[motionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye) is a web-based frontend for [motion](https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion).

This container runs in alpine:latest and contains only motionEye and not motion itself, so you will need to install motion on whatever your camera/s is/are connected to.

Default credentials are `admin/<blank>`. Be sure to look at and change the settings.
